# Explohh-for-Miles_2D
Oh hey. Welcome to my framework for a game with realistic/Earth-like physics which can be changed to apply to any & other games! We stickin' with 2D for now for simplicity. (Might use a game engine for this and/or the 3D equivalent)

Now the next time I'll be active, we'll start with SUVAT, Forces, Energy & Friction (varies by collision & floor surface/type)!
